**AS A** film director **I WANT T0** have access to my plan **SO THAT** I can stay on task and complete my film on time.

**AS AN** investor **I WANT TO** be aware of the progress of the film **SO THAT** I can make adjustments to protect the financial health of the film.

**AS A** film student **I WANT TO** learn the process of filmmaking **SO THAT** I can copy and adjust the process to make my own films.
